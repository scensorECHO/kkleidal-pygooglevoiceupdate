About This Repository
----------------------

I was working through a few other old codebases of the project, stuff originating from 2008/9 like this, and found there were plenty of issues with the older codebase. I found this updated project on Google Code and imported it to maintain an up to date system. My hopes are to standardize this one, and update it as problems occur. Feel free to fork this and make a pull request on any improvements you make, in order to consolidate a single location for this project. 

Exposing the Google Voice "API" to the Python language
-------------------------------------------------------

Google Voice for Python Allows you to place calls, send sms, download voicemail, and check the various folders of your Google Voice Accounts.
You can use the Python API or command line script to schedule calls, check for new recieved calls/sms, or even sync your recorded voicemails/calls.  
Works for Python 2 and Python 3
